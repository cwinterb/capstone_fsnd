This is the capstone project for the Full Stack Developer Nanodegree. This simple application has two data tables - Projects and Actors. Projects have attributes Title and Release Date, while Actors have names, genders, and ages.

This application uses Auth0 to manage different user types and permissions. Casting Assistants have the most limited permissions - with the ability to only view actors and movies. Casting Directors can do everything Casting Assistants can do and also edit (patch) actors and projects and create new actors. Executive Producers have Casting Director permissions and can also create new projects.
